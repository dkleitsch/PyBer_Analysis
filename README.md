# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, an analysis of Pyber's ride-sharing data was conducted to determine the differences between types of cities: Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  The results of the analysis will be used by Pyber's decision-makers to determine how to improve the availablity of its services in underserved areas.

### Summary of Data

The most notable finding from this analysis is the difference between the urban and rural city types.  There are significantly more drivers working in the urban cities than in the rural cities (2,405 compared to 78).  Additionally, more total rides were completed in the urban cities than the rural cities (1,625 compared to 125).  Furthermore, it is more expensive, on average, to use Pyber in rural cities than in urban cities ($34.62 compared to $24.53).
### Total Fares by City Type

Between January and April 2019, Pyber made about four times more money in fares, per week, from rides in urban cities compared to rural cities.  
## Summary
Based on this analysis, the desparity between Pyber services in urban and rural cities is clear.  One way to improve this desparity is to recruit more drivers in rural cities.  This will allow for more people to use Pyber's services.  Pyber could offer sign on bonuses or higher wages for drivers who would work in rural cities.  Another possible solution would be to reduce the cost of rides in rural cities.  The profits made in urban cities could be used to offset any potential losses in rural cities.  Finally, Pyber could also attract more riders in rural cities by offering reduced rates based on the number of rides taken by each rider.  If a rider takes, say ten rides in one month, then the next month that rider would be offered a ten percent discount for that month.
